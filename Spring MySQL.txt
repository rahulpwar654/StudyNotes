here are some Spring Boot MySQL specific annotations:

@Table
This annotation marks a class as a MySQL table.
The annotation takes an optional name attribute that specifies the name of the table in the database.
@Id
This annotation marks a field as the table's ID.
The ID field must be unique and immutable.
@GeneratedValue
This annotation specifies how the ID field is generated.
The annotation takes an optional strategy attribute that specifies the generation strategy.
@Column
This annotation marks a field as a column in the table.
The annotation takes an optional name attribute that specifies the name of the column in the database.
@Transient
This annotation marks a field as a transient property.
Transient properties are not stored in the database.
Here is an example of a Spring Boot MySQL annotated class:

Java
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

  @Id
  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
  private Long id;

  @Column(name = "name")
  private String name;

  @Column(name = "email")
  private String email;

  @Transient
  private Address address;

}
