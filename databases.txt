DATABASES


In a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), **keys** are essential 
for ensuring data integrity, uniqueness, and efficient access. 
They help define relationships between tables and uniquely identify records. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the main types of keys you‚Äôll encounter:

---

### üîë 1. **Primary Key**
- Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- Cannot contain `NULL` values.
- Each table can have **only one** primary key.
- Example: `StudentID` in a `Students` table.

---

### üß™ 2. **Candidate Key**
- A minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record.
- Every candidate key is a potential primary key.
- A table can have **multiple candidate keys**, but only one is chosen as the primary key.
- Example: `Email` and `StudentID` could both be candidate keys.

---

### ü¶∏ 3. **Super Key**
- A set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify a record.
- May include extra attributes beyond what's necessary.
- All candidate keys are super keys, but not all super keys are candidate keys.
- Example: `{StudentID, Name}` is a super key if `StudentID` alone is sufficient.

---

### üîÅ 4. **Foreign Key**
- Refers to the primary key in another table.
- Used to establish relationships between tables.
- Can contain `NULL` values unless explicitly restricted.
- Example: `CourseID` in `Enrollments` table referencing `CourseID` in `Courses` table.

---

### üîÑ 5. **Alternate Key**
- Candidate keys that were **not chosen** as the primary key.
- Still unique and can be used for lookups.
- Example: If `StudentID` is primary, then `Email` is an alternate key.

---

### üß© 6. **Composite Key**
- A key made up of **two or more columns** to uniquely identify a record.
- Used when no single column is sufficient.
- Example: `{StudentID, CourseID}` in an `Enrollments` table.

---

### üß± 7. **Compound Key**
- Similar to composite key, but specifically refers to keys made from **multiple foreign keys**.
- Often used in junction tables for many-to-many relationships.

---

### üßô 8. **Surrogate Key**
- A system-generated key (like an auto-incremented ID).
- Not derived from application data.
- Used when no natural key exists or for performance reasons.

Each key type plays a distinct role in structuring and securing your data. If you‚Äôre designing a schema or optimizing queries, choosing the right key types is crucial. Want help modeling a specific table or relationship? I‚Äôd be happy to walk through it with you.

Indexing in databases is like creating a roadmap for faster data retrieval. Instead of scanning entire tables, indexes help the database engine jump directly to the relevant rows. Here's a breakdown of the **main types of indexing** used across relational and NoSQL databases:

---

### üß≠ Core Types of Indexing

| **Index Type**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Index**     | Built on the primary key. Entries are sorted and directly point to data blocks. |
| **Secondary Index**   | Built on non-primary columns. Useful for searching by alternate keys.           |
| **Clustered Index**   | Data rows are physically stored in the order of the index. One per table.       |
| **Non-Clustered Index** | Index is separate from the data. Multiple allowed per table.                  |
| **Composite Index**   | Index on multiple columns. Speeds up multi-column queries.                      |
| **Unique Index**      | Ensures all values in the indexed column(s) are unique.                         |
| **Full-Text Index**   | Optimized for searching large text fields (e.g., articles, descriptions).       |
| **Filtered Index**    | Indexes only a subset of rows based on a condition.                             |
| **Spatial Index**     | Used for geospatial queries (e.g., latitude/longitude).                         |

---

### üîç Specialized Indexing Techniques

- **Dense Index**: Every search key has an index entry. Fast but space-heavy.
- **Sparse Index**: Index entries only for some keys. Saves space, slower lookups.
- **Hash Index**: Uses a hash function for exact-match queries. Not ideal for range queries.
- **B-Tree / B+Tree Index**: Balanced tree structure. Supports range queries and sorting.
- **Bitmap Index**: Efficient for columns with low cardinality (e.g., gender, status).
- **Multilevel Index**: Index on top of another index. Useful for very large datasets.

---

### üß† Real-World Example

In a banking app:
- **Primary Index** on `account_id`
- **Secondary Index** on `branch_code`
- **Composite Index** on `customer_id + transaction_date`
- **Full-Text Index** on `transaction_notes`

Let‚Äôs demystify two powerful techniques for scaling databases: **partitioning** and **sharding**. They sound similar but serve different architectural purposes.

---

### üß© Partitioning

**Definition:**  
Partitioning splits a single database table into smaller, more manageable pieces called **partitions**, all within the same database instance.

**Types of Partitioning:**
- **Horizontal Partitioning**: Rows are divided based on a key (e.g., date ranges).
- **Vertical Partitioning**: Columns are split across tables (e.g., separating user profile from login credentials).
- **Range Partitioning**: Based on value ranges (e.g., orders by year).
- **List Partitioning**: Based on discrete values (e.g., region = 'US', 'EU').
- **Hash Partitioning**: Uses a hash function to distribute rows evenly.

**Use Case:**  
Improves query performance and maintenance within a single DB. Ideal for large tables with predictable access patterns.

---

### üåê Sharding

**Definition:**  
Sharding is a form of **horizontal partitioning** where data is split across **multiple database instances** (often on different servers). Each shard is a self-contained DB holding a subset of the data.

**Types of Sharding:**
- **Range-based Sharding**: Shards based on value ranges (e.g., user ID 1‚Äì1000).
- **Hash-based Sharding**: Uses a hash function to assign data to shards.
- **Geo-based Sharding**: Shards based on geographic location.
- **Composite Sharding**: Combines multiple strategies.

**Use Case:**  
Essential for high-traffic, large-scale systems like social media, e-commerce, or SaaS platforms. Enables horizontal scaling and fault isolation.

### üîç Key Differences

| Feature              | Partitioning                          | Sharding                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Scope                | Within a single DB instance            | Across multiple DB instances              |
| Scalability          | Limited to one server                 | Horizontally scalable across servers      |
| Complexity           | Easier to manage                      | More complex (routing, consistency)       |
| Joins                | Efficient within partitions           | Expensive across shards                   |
| Use Case             | Query optimization                    | Distributed systems, massive datasets     |
