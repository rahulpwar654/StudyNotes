Hiding Endpoints From Swagger


# Paths to exclude
springdoc.paths-to-exclude=/swagger-resources/**

You can use the @Hidden annotation from swagger-annotations, on the top of the controller you want to hide.

Or you can use properties to filter the endpoints to show, filtering by path or package:

# Packages to include
springdoc.packagesToScan=com.package1, com.package2
or

# Paths to include
springdoc.pathsToMatch=/v1, /api/balance/**



2. Hiding an Endpoint with @ApiIgnore

@ApiIgnore
@ApiOperation(value = "This method is used to get the author name.")
@GetMapping("/getAuthor")
public String getAuthor() {
    return "Umang Budhwar";
}



4. Hiding All Endpoints with @ApiIgnore  (on COntroller)

@ApiIgnore
@RestController
public class RegularRestController {
    // regular code
}
