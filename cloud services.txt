Designing systems on AWS involves a rich set of components that help build scalable, secure, and resilient architectures. Here's a breakdown of the key building blocks you‚Äôll want to know:

---

### üß± Core Components of AWS System Design

#### 1. **Compute**
- **Amazon EC2**: Virtual servers for running applications.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute service for event-driven architecture.
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts capacity to maintain performance.

#### 2. **Storage**
- **Amazon S3**: Object storage for files, backups, and static content.
- **Amazon EBS**: Block storage for EC2 instances.
- **Amazon Glacier**: Archival storage for long-term data retention.

#### 3. **Database**
- **Amazon RDS**: Managed relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for high-performance apps.
- **Amazon ElastiCache**: In-memory caching for faster data access.

#### 4. **Networking**
- **Amazon VPC**: Isolated cloud network for your resources.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across multiple targets.
- **Amazon CloudFront**: CDN for delivering content globally with low latency.

#### 5. **Security**
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: Controls access to AWS resources.
- **AWS Shield & WAF**: Protects against DDoS and web attacks.
- **KMS (Key Management Service)**: Manages encryption keys.

#### 6. **Monitoring & Logging**
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitors resources and applications.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Logs API calls for auditing.
- **AWS Config**: Tracks resource configurations and changes.

#### 7. **Integration & Messaging**
- **Amazon SQS**: Message queuing for decoupled systems.
- **Amazon SNS**: Pub/sub messaging for notifications.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Event bus for connecting services.

#### 8. **Application Services**
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages APIs with throttling and security.
- **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrates workflows between services.
- **AWS AppSync**: GraphQL-based API service for real-time data.

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Patterns

- **Monolithic Architecture**: All-in-one application, simpler but less scalable.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Independent services communicating via APIs, ideal for scalability and maintainability.
- **Multi-Tier Architecture**: Separates presentation, application, and data layers for modular design.
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Uses queues and events to reduce dependencies between components.

### üìê AWS Well-Architected Framework

AWS promotes six pillars for designing robust systems:
- **Operational Excellence**
- **Security**
- **Reliability**
- **Performance Efficiency**
- **Cost Optimization**
- **Sustainability**
