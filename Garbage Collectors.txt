Garbage Collectors

1)PermGen  Vs  Metaspace 
https://www.baeldung.com/java-permgen-metaspace#:~:text=Simply%20put%2C%20Metaspace%20is%20a,region%20grows%20automatically%20by%20default.



PermGen
PermGen (Permanent Generation) is a special heap space separated from the main memory heap.

The JVM keeps track of loaded class metadata in the PermGen. Additionally, the JVM stores all the static content in this memory section. 
This includes all the static methods, primitive variables, and references to the static objects.

Furthermore, it contains data about bytecode, names, and JIT information. Before Java 7, the String Pool was also part of this memory. 
The disadvantages of the fixed pool size are listed in our write-up.



3. Metaspace
Simply put, Metaspace is a new memory space ‚Äì starting from the Java 8 version; it has replaced the older PermGen memory space. 
The most significant difference is how it handles memory allocation.

Specifically, this native memory region grows automatically by default.

We also have new flags to tune the memory:

MetaspaceSize and MaxMetaspaceSize ‚Äì we can set the Metaspace upper bounds.
MinMetaspaceFreeRatio ‚Äì is the minimum percentage of class metadata capacity free after garbage collection
MaxMetaspaceFreeRatio ‚Äì is the maximum percentage of class metadata capacity free after a garbage collection 
to avoid a reduction in the amount of space
Additionally, the garbage collection process also gains some benefits from this change. The garbage collector 
now automatically triggers the cleaning of the dead classes once the class metadata usage reaches its maximum metaspace size.

Therefore, with this improvement, JVM reduces the chance to get the OutOfMemory error.

################################################################
Java 7 Changes
Few things were moved out of PermGen MemorySpace

Symbols were moved to native memory
Interned String were moved to Java Heap
Class statics were also moved to Java Heap.
Above changes can also be reverted back in JDK 1.7 using JVM options.

Java 8 Changes
PermGen removed and replaced with MetaSpace.
Class and metadata moved to MetaSpace.
MetaSpace is not contiguous with Java Heap and allocated out of Native memory. 
This means it can use available memory from system upto max memory, until... read below
MetaSpace size max limit can be configured using JVM options.
G1 starts supporting concurrent unloading of Classes.
Code Cache is introduced. It stores compiled code by JIT compilor.
Compressed Class Space is also introduced.



Java 9 Changes
G1 is default garbage collector
Concurrent Mark Sweep(CMS) is planned for removal.
Some GC combinations for Young and Old Generation collections are also removed.





In Java 8, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) memory structure consists of several different areas, 
each with a specific purpose. These memory areas are crucial for managing the execution of Java applications efficiently and safely. 
Here's an overview of the JVM memory structure in Java 8 and how it allocates memory:

1. **Heap Memory**:
   - **Young Generation**:
     - **Eden Space**: This is where new objects are initially allocated. It's divided into multiple regions.
     - **Survivor Spaces (S0 and S1)**: Objects that survive one garbage collection cycle in Eden move to one of these survivor spaces.
   - **Old Generation (Tenured Generation)**: Objects that survive multiple garbage collection cycles in the Young Generation 
   eventually get promoted to the Old Generation.
   - **Permanent Generation (PermGen)** (Note: In Java 8, PermGen was replaced with Metaspace): It stores class metadata, 
   constant pool data, and interned strings.

   The heap memory is where most of your application's objects are allocated. The Java Garbage Collector (GC) 
   primarily operates within the heap memory to clean up objects that are no longer in use.

2. **Method Area (Non-Heap Memory)**:
   - This is where class metadata, static variables, and code of methods are stored. In Java 8 and later, 
   the Method Area has been replaced by Metaspace, which is a native memory area that can dynamically expand and contract.

3. **Java Virtual Machine Stacks**:
   - Each thread running in the JVM has its own JVM stack, which is used for storing local variables, 
   method call frames, and managing method invocations.

4. **Native Method Stacks**:
   - Similar to the JVM stacks, but used for native methods (methods written in a language other than Java, like C or C++).

5. **PC Registers**:
   - Each thread has its own program counter (PC) register, which keeps track of the current execution point.

6. **Direct Memory (Native Memory)**:
   - Memory allocated outside of the Java heap, typically used for I/O operations and interacting with native libraries.

Now, let's discuss how memory allocation works in Java 8:

- When a Java program starts, the JVM reserves an initial amount of memory for the heap and other memory areas.

- Objects are created in the heap memory using the `new` keyword or other object creation mechanisms.

- The JVM uses a garbage collector to identify and reclaim memory that is no longer reachable by the program. 
The garbage collector works primarily in the Young Generation and occasionally promotes objects to the Old Generation.

- The PermGen area, where class metadata and constants were stored in older Java versions, has been replaced by Metaspace in Java 8. 
Metaspace dynamically allocates native memory for class metadata and can automatically resize itself as needed.

- The Java stacks are used for managing method calls and local variables. Each thread has its own stack.

- Direct memory is allocated using libraries like `ByteBuffer` for handling I/O operations and working with native code.

It's important to note that memory management and garbage collection in Java are automated processes managed by the JVM. 
Developers generally don't need to worry about memory allocation and deallocation, but they should be aware of 
these memory areas and understand how their application's memory usage impacts performance and potential memory-related issues.

Java offers several types of **Garbage Collectors (GCs)**, each optimized for different application needs. Here's a breakdown of the main types:

---

## üßπ Types of Garbage Collectors in Java

| GC Type   | Description                                                                  | Best Use Case |
|--------   |-------------                                                                  |----------------|
| **Serial GC** | Uses a single thread for garbage collection. Causes "stop-the-world" pauses. | Small applications or single-threaded environments. |
| **Parallel GC** | Uses multiple threads for GC. Also pauses application threads during collection. | High-throughput applications where pause time is acceptable. |
| **Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS)** | Performs most GC work concurrently with application threads. Reduces pause time. | Applications needing low-latency and shorter GC pauses. |
| **G1 GC (Garbage First)** | Divides heap into regions and collects them incrementally. Balances throughput and pause time. | Large applications with predictable pause-time goals. |
| **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)** | Scalable, low-latency GC for heaps up to terabytes. Most operations are concurrent. | Ultra-low pause time applications with large heaps. |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Enable a Specific GC

Use JVM arguments when launching your application:

```bash
# Serial GC
java -XX:+UseSerialGC -jar app.jar

# Parallel GC
java -XX:+UseParallelGC -jar app.jar

# CMS GC
java -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -jar app.jar

# G1 GC (default in Java 9+)
java -XX:+UseG1GC -jar app.jar

# ZGC (Java 11+)
java -XX:+UseZGC -jar app.jar
```

---

## üß† Choosing the Right GC

- **For small apps**: Serial GC
- **For batch processing**: Parallel GC
- **For responsive apps**: CMS or G1
- **For massive heaps and ultra-low latency**: ZGC

Absolutely! Here's a simple, point-by-point explanation of how **Generational Garbage Collection (GC)** works:

---

## üå± Generational GC ‚Äì Simplified Breakdown

Generational GC is based on the observation that **most objects die young**. So it divides the heap into **generations** and treats them differently.

---

### üßí 1. **Heap Is Divided into Generations**
- **Young Generation**: Newly created objects.
- **Old (Tenured) Generation**: Long-lived objects.
- **(Optional) Permanent Generation**: Metadata like class definitions (used in older JVMs).

---

### üöº 2. **Young Generation ‚Äì Where Most GC Happens**
- Contains:
  - **Eden space**: Where new objects are allocated.
  - **Survivor spaces (S0 and S1)**: Where surviving objects are moved temporarily.

---

### üßπ 3. **Minor GC ‚Äì Fast and Frequent**
- Happens in the **Young Generation**.
- Steps:
  1. Most objects in Eden die quickly.
  2. Surviving objects are moved to Survivor space.
  3. If they survive multiple GCs, they are promoted to the **Old Generation**.

---

### üßì 4. **Old Generation ‚Äì Less Frequent GC**
- Holds objects that lived long enough to be promoted.
- GC here is called **Major GC** or **Full GC**.
- It‚Äôs slower and more expensive, so it happens less often.

---

### üîÅ 5. **Promotion Strategy**
- Objects that survive **N** Minor GCs are promoted to the Old Generation.
- This avoids wasting time collecting objects that are likely to die soon.

---

### üß† 6. **Why This Works Well**
- Most objects are short-lived (e.g., temporary variables).
- Minor GC is fast because it deals with a small area.
- Major GC is rare, reducing pause times.

---

## üìä Summary Table

| Generation       | Purpose                        | GC Type     | Frequency | Speed     |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Young Generation | New, short-lived objects       | Minor GC    | Frequent  | Fast      |
| Old Generation   | Long-lived, promoted objects   | Major/Full GC | Rare     | Slow      |

Great! Here's a **comparison between Generational GC and Mark-Sweep GC**, laid out clearly to highlight their differences and strengths:

---

## üÜö Generational GC vs. Mark-Sweep GC

| Feature                     | **Generational GC**                              | **Mark-Sweep GC**                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| üîÑ **GC Strategy**          | Divides heap into generations                    | Treats entire heap as one                     |
| üßí **Young Object Handling**| Optimized for short-lived objects                | No special treatment                          |
| üßπ **GC Types**             | Minor GC (young) & Major GC (old)               | Single GC process for all objects             |
| ‚ö° **Performance**          | Faster due to frequent minor GCs                | Slower due to full heap scans                 |
| üßì **Long-Lived Objects**   | Promoted to old generation                      | All objects treated equally                   |
| üß† **Efficiency**           | High, due to generational separation            | Lower, especially with many short-lived objects |
| üßº **Memory Fragmentation** | Can be reduced with compaction in old gen       | High fragmentation unless combined with compaction |
| ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pause Times**         | Shorter (minor GC), longer (major GC)           | Longer pause times overall                    |
| üîß **Implementation Complexity** | More complex due to multiple generations     | Simpler to implement                          |

## üß¨ Visual Comparison

### Mark-Sweep GC:
```
[Entire Heap]
   ‚Üì
Mark reachable objects
   ‚Üì
Sweep unreachable ones
```

### Generational GC:
```
[Heap]
 ‚îú‚îÄ Young Gen (Eden + Survivor)
 ‚îÇ    ‚Üì Minor GC (frequent, fast)
 ‚îî‚îÄ Old Gen
      ‚Üì Major GC (rare, slow)
```

---

## üèÜ Which One Is Better?

- **Generational GC** is generally preferred in modern systems (like JVMs) because:
  - It‚Äôs **faster** and **more efficient**.
  - It **reduces pause times**.
  - It **handles short-lived objects** more intelligently.

- **Mark-Sweep GC** is simpler and still useful in systems with predictable memory usage or limited resources.
