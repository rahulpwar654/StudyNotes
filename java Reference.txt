Excellent question! In Java, `WeakReference`, `SoftReference`, and `PhantomReference` are part of the `java.lang.ref` package and 
offer different levels of interaction with the garbage collector (GC). 
They‚Äôre especially useful when managing memory-sensitive applications. 
Here's a breakdown of how they differ:

---

### üîπ **SoftReference**
- **GC Behavior:** Cleared **only when memory is low**.
- **Use Case:** Ideal for **caching**‚Äîobjects are kept as long as memory allows.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  SoftReference<MyObject> softRef = new SoftReference<>(new MyObject());
  ```

---

### üî∏ **WeakReference**
- **GC Behavior:** Cleared **as soon as no strong references exist**.
- **Use Case:** Useful for **metadata**, listeners, or mappings that shouldn't prevent GC.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  WeakReference<MyObject> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new MyObject());
  ```

---

### ‚ö´ **PhantomReference**
- **GC Behavior:** Object is **already finalized and collected**, but reference is enqueued **after GC**.
- **Use Case:** Used for **post-mortem cleanup**‚Äîlike releasing native resources.
- **Requires:** A `ReferenceQueue` to detect when object is enqueued.
- **Example:**
  ```java
  ReferenceQueue<MyObject> queue = new ReferenceQueue<>();
  PhantomReference<MyObject> phantomRef = new PhantomReference<>(new MyObject(), queue);
  ```

### üß† Summary Table

| Reference Type     | Cleared When?                     | Can Access Object? | Use Case                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| SoftReference      | JVM needs memory                  | ‚úÖ Yes (`get()`)     | Caching                      |
| WeakReference      | No strong references exist        | ‚úÖ Yes (`get()`)     | Metadata, weak maps          |
| PhantomReference   | After GC and finalization         | ‚ùå No (`get()` returns null) | Resource cleanup, monitoring |

These reference types give you fine-grained control over memory management. 
If you're building a cache, go soft. 
For non-blocking references, go weak. 
And for cleanup after GC, phantom is your tool.
