| 1 | Data at Rest & Data in Transit<br>Cybersecurity and Data Protection<br>Presented by: [Your Name], [Date] | Intro | “Welcome — today we’ll explore securing data at rest and in transit, breaking down concepts, threats, and best practices.” |
| 2 | Agenda<br>- Definitions and concepts<br>- Threat landscape<br>- Security measures<br>- Real-world examples<br>- Best practices<br>- Compliance<br>- Q&A | Intro | “Here’s our roadmap — we’ll go from definitions, to threats, security solutions, examples, compliance, then Q&A.” |
| 3 | Introduction<br> - Data is a critical asset<br>- Faces threats in different states<br>- Key states: Data at Rest & Data in Transit<br>- Require different defenses | Intro | “Data exists in different states, each with unique vulnerabilities. Knowing the state is key to protection.” |
| 4 | Data at Rest<br>- Stored and inactive<br>- DBs, files, cloud storage, backups<br>- Risks: Theft, misconfigurations, insider threats | Definitions | “Data at rest is essentially parked data — we protect it with encryption, access control, and secure storage.” |
| 5 | Data in Transit<br>- Moving between locations<br>- Over networks, APIs, email<br>- Risks: Interception, tampering | Definitions | “Data in transit travels between systems — protect with encryption, authentication, and secure protocols.” |
| 6 | Data Lifecycle (insert circular diagram)<br>Create → Store → Use → Share → Archive → Destroy | Definitions | “Data moves through a lifecycle — at some points it’s in motion, others at rest, each stage needs security.” |
| 7 | Threats to Data at Rest<br>- Device theft<br>- Insider access<br>- Ransomware<br>- Cloud misconfiguration | Threats | “Even when not moving, data can be stolen — physical theft, insider misuse, and ransomware are prime examples.” |
| 8 | Threats to Data in Transit<br>- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)<br>- Packet sniffing<br>- Session hijacking<br>- DNS spoofing | Threats | “Without secure transmission, attackers can intercept or alter moving data.” |
| 9 | Protecting Data at Rest<br>- AES-256 encryption<br>- Access controls (RBAC)<br>- Physical server security<br>- Encrypted backups/cloud | Security | “Layered security — encryption, access restrictions, and proper storage hardening are essential.” |
| 10 | Protecting Data in Transit<br>- TLS/SSL (HTTPS)<br>- VPNs / SSH<br>- Secure APIs (OAuth, signed requests)<br>- S/MIME, PGP for email | Security | “Any communication carrying sensitive data should be encrypted end-to-end or tunneled securely.” |
| 11 | Encryption Types (insert 3-column graphic)<br>- Symmetric<br>- Asymmetric<br>- Hybrid | Encryption | “Symmetric uses one key, asymmetric uses pairs — hybrid combines both for performance and security.” |
| 12 | Visual Overview (split screen diagram)<br>Data at Rest → Encrypted on disk<br>Data in Transit → Encrypted over network (TLS) | Encryption | “This visual shows where we apply encryption depending on the data state.” |
| 13 | Real-World Examples<br>- WhatsApp (E2E encryption)<br>- AWS S3 (AES-256 at rest + HTTPS in transit)<br>- SFTP vs FTP | Examples | “Similar principles apply from cloud storage to messaging — both states need protection.” |
| 14 | Best Practices<br>- Encrypt everywhere<br>- Strong key management<br>- Limit data retention<br>- Patch & update<br>- Monitor & audit | Security | “Holistic protection: secure by design, not just in parts.” |
| 15 | Compliance<br>- GDPR<br>- HIPAA<br>- PCI DSS<br>- ISO 27001 | Compliance | “Compliance frameworks often mandate encryption & data protection across both states.” |
| 16 | Summary<br>Data at Rest → Stored → Encrypt & limit access<br>Data in Transit → Moving → Encrypt channels & authenticate | Summary | “Different states, same goal: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.” |
| 17 | Q&A (simple graphic of question mark) | Q&A | “Thanks for attending — happy to take your questions.” |
