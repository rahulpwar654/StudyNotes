| 1       | **Data at Rest & Data in Transit**<br>Cybersecurity and Data Protection<br>Presented by: \[Your Name], \[Date]                                                                                                                      | Intro               | “Welcome! Today we will explore how to protect data when it’s stored and when it’s being transmitted. We’ll cover threats, defenses, and best practices.” |
| 2       | **Agenda**<br>- Definitions and key concepts<br>- Common threats<br>- Security controls and tools<br>- Real-world use cases<br>- Best practices<br>- Regulatory compliance<br>- Q\&A                                                | Intro               | “Here’s the agenda. We’ll start with the basics, then walk through risks, solutions, examples, compliance requirements, and wrap up with questions.”      |
| 3       | **Introduction**<br>- Data is one of the most valuable assets<br>- Vulnerable in different states<br>- Main states: Data at Rest & Data in Transit<br>- Require tailored protection strategies                                      | Intro               | “Data isn’t always active—it’s stored or moving. Each state introduces different risks and needs specific protections.”                                   |
| 4       | **What is Data at Rest?**<br>- Data that is stored and not actively being used<br>- Examples: Databases, files, cloud storage, backups<br>- Risks: Theft, insider misuse, ransomware attacks, misconfigurations                     | Definitions         | “Data at rest is static. It’s stored on disks or cloud environments and must be secured from theft or accidental exposure.”                               |
| 5       | **What is Data in Transit?**<br>- Data actively moving between systems<br>- Examples: Network transfers, APIs, emails<br>- Risks: Interception, manipulation, unauthorized access                                                   | Definitions         | “Data in transit moves over networks. It’s exposed to attacks like interception or tampering if not properly encrypted.”                                  |
| 6       | **Data Lifecycle**<br>Create → Store → Use → Share → Archive → Destroy                                                                                                                                                              | Definitions         | “Data moves through multiple stages—sometimes at rest, sometimes in transit. Security measures must be applied at each step.”                             |
| 7       | **Threats to Data at Rest**<br>- Device theft or loss<br>- Insider threats<br>- Ransomware attacks<br>- Cloud storage misconfigurations                                                                                             | Threats             | “Stored data is not immune to risks. Physical theft, insider misuse, and ransomware can compromise sensitive information.”                                |
| 8       | **Threats to Data in Transit**<br>- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks<br>- Packet sniffing<br>- Session hijacking<br>- DNS spoofing                                                                                                  | Threats             | “While data is being transferred, attackers can intercept or alter it unless secure protocols are in place.”                                              |
| 9       | **Protecting Data at Rest**<br>- Strong encryption (AES-256)<br>- Role-based access control (RBAC)<br>- Physical and logical security measures<br>- Encrypted backups and secure cloud storage                                      | Security            | “A layered approach works best: encrypt data, control access, and ensure backups are also secure.”                                                        |
| 10      | **Protecting Data in Transit**<br>- TLS/SSL (HTTPS)<br>- VPNs and SSH tunnels<br>- Secure APIs with OAuth and signed requests<br>- Email encryption: S/MIME, PGP                                                                    | Security            | “Securing moving data requires encrypted channels, authenticated users, and trusted endpoints.”                                                           |
| 11      | **Encryption Types**<br>- Symmetric Encryption: One key for encrypting and decrypting<br>- Asymmetric Encryption: Public and private key pairs<br>- Hybrid Encryption: Combines both for performance and security                   | Encryption          | “Different encryption methods serve different purposes—combining them ensures both speed and security.”                                                   |
| 12      | **Visual Overview**<br>Data at Rest → Encrypted on disk<br>Data in Transit → Encrypted during transmission (TLS/SSL)                                                                                                                | Encryption          | “Encryption must be applied depending on where the data is—whether stored or traveling between systems.”                                                  |
| 13      | **Real-World Examples**<br>- WhatsApp: End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)<br>- AWS S3: AES-256 at rest + HTTPS in transit<br>- SFTP vs FTP: Secure file transfer vs unsecured                                                             | Examples            | “Applications from messaging to cloud storage all rely on encryption for protecting data in both states.”                                                 |
| 14      | **Best Practices**<br>- Encrypt data everywhere, always<br>- Implement strong key management<br>- Minimize data retention periods<br>- Regularly patch and update systems<br>- Monitor and audit access logs                        | Security            | “Security isn’t a one-time action—it requires continuous effort and vigilance across systems.”                                                            |
| 15      | **Compliance Frameworks**<br>- GDPR: Data protection across EU<br>- HIPAA: Healthcare data security<br>- PCI DSS: Payment data protection<br>- ISO 27001: Information security standards                                            | Compliance          | “Many regulations mandate encryption and access controls—understanding them helps meet legal requirements.”                                               |
| 16      | **Summary**<br>- Data at Rest → Store data safely with encryption and access control<br>- Data in Transit → Encrypt communication channels and authenticate users<br>- Goal → Maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability | Summary             | “Different states, same objective: protecting data from threats while ensuring it’s available when needed.”                                               |
