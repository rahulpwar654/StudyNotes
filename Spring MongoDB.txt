here are some Spring Boot MongoDB specific annotations:

@Document
This annotation marks a class as a MongoDB document.
The annotation takes an optional collection attribute that specifies the name of the collection in the database where the document will be stored.
@Id
This annotation marks a field as the document's ID.
The ID field must be unique and immutable.
@Field
This annotation marks a field as a property of the document.
The annotation takes an optional name attribute that specifies the name of the property in the database.
@DBRef
This annotation marks a field as a reference to another document.
The annotation takes an optional db and collection attributes that specify the database and collection where the referenced document is stored.
@Transient
This annotation marks a field as a transient property.
Transient properties are not stored in the database.
Here is an example of a Spring Boot MongoDB annotated class:

Java
@Document(collection = "users")
public class User {

  @Id
  private String id;

  @Field(name = "name")
  private String name;

  @Field(name = "email")
  private String email;

  @DBRef
  private Address address;

}
