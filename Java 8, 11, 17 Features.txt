 Java Features
 
 
Java 8 features:


Lambda expressions: Lambda expressions are anonymous functions that can be used to pass code as arguments to methods or constructors.
They are a concise way to represent blocks of code, and they can help to make code more readable and maintainable.

Functional interfaces: Functional interfaces are interfaces that have only one abstract method. 
They are used in conjunction with lambda expressions, and they make it easier to write code that is declarative and functional.

Stream API: The Stream API is a new library that provides a way to perform operations on collections of data in a sequential 
or parallel manner. It is a powerful tool that can be used to simplify and improve the performance of data processing code.

Default methods: Default methods are methods that are declared in an interface 
but can also be overridden by implementations of the interface. 
They provide a way to add new functionality to interfaces without breaking existing code.

Optional class: The Optional class is a new class that represents a value that may be null. 
It provides a way to handle null values in a safe 
and concise manner.

Date and time API: The Date and time API is a new library that provides a more modern and efficient way to represent dates and times in Java.






Java 11 features: 


HTTP Client API: A standard HTTP client API that supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

Z Garbage Collector: A low-latency garbage collector that can be used to improve the performance of Java applications.

Nest-based access control: A new access control mechanism that allows developers to control access to classes and methods based 
on their nesting structure.

Multi-release JAR files: A new type of JAR file that can contain multiple versions of class files, making it easier for library 
developers to support multiple versions of Java.

Support for Unicode 10: Support for the latest version of the Unicode standard, which includes new characters and symbols.

Removal of the Java EE and CORBA modules: The Java EE and CORBA modules have been removed from Java 11, as they are no longer widely used.



Java 17 features

Restore Always-Strict Floating-Point Semantics: This feature restores the default floating-point semantics to be strict, which means that 
all floating-point operations are checked for overflow and underflow. This can help to improve the accuracy of floating-point calculations.

Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators: This feature provides a new interface type and implementations for pseudorandom number generators
 to make it easier to use various PRNG algorithms and to better support stream-based operations.
 
New macOS Rendering Pipeline: This feature provides a new rendering pipeline for macOS that can improve the performance of Java applications on macOS.

macOS/AArch64 Port: This feature provides a port of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to the Apple M1 chip, which is based on the ARM64 architecture.
 This allows Java applications to run natively on Apple M1 Macs.
 
Deprecate the Applet API for Removal: This feature deprecates the Applet API, which is a deprecated technology that is no longer widely used.

Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals: This feature makes it more difficult for developers to access JDK internals, 
which can help to improve the security of Java applications.

Pattern Matching for Switch (Preview): This feature introduces a preview of pattern matching for the switch statement,
 which can make it more concise and expressive to write switch statements.
 
Remove RMI Activation: This feature removes the RMI Activation mechanism, which is a deprecated technology that is no longer widely used.

Sealed Classes: This feature introduces sealed classes, which are a new type of class that can be used to restrict the subclasses that 
can be created from them. This can be used to improve the safety and security of Java code.


Remove the Experimental AOT and JIT Compiler: This feature removes the experimental AOT and JIT compilers, 
which are no longer under active development.
