S3 Bucket

Let‚Äôs create such user. Go to Services -> IAM. In the navigation pane, choose Users and then choose Add user.

Then press next and ‚ÄòCreate User‚Äô. If you did everything right then you should see Access key ID and Secret access key for your user. There is also ‚ÄòDownload .csv‚Äô button for downloading these keys, so please click on it in order not to loose keys.

Our S3 Bucket configuration is done so let‚Äôs proceed to Spring Boot application.


Spring Boot Part

<dependency>
   <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>
   <artifactId>aws-java-sdk</artifactId>
   <version>1.11.133</version>
</dependency>




Now let‚Äôs add s3 bucket properties to our application.yml file:

amazonProperties:
  endpointUrl: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
  accessKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  secretKey: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  bucketName: your-bucket-name
  
  
  
  
  
  It‚Äôs time to create our RestController with two request mappings ‚Äú/uploadFile‚Äù and ‚Äú/deleteFile‚Äù.

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/storage/")
public class BucketController {

    private AmazonClient amazonClient;

    @Autowired
    BucketController(AmazonClient amazonClient) {
        this.amazonClient = amazonClient;
    }

    @PostMapping("/uploadFile")
    public String uploadFile(@RequestPart(value = "file") MultipartFile file) {
        return this.amazonClient.uploadFile(file);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/deleteFile")
    public String deleteFile(@RequestPart(value = "url") String fileUrl) {
        return this.amazonClient.deleteFileFromS3Bucket(fileUrl);
    }
}





This code is actually broken because we don‚Äôt have AmazonClient class yet, so let‚Äôs create this class with the following fields.

@Service
public class AmazonClient {

    private AmazonS3 s3client;

    @Value("${amazonProperties.endpointUrl}")
    private String endpointUrl;
    @Value("${amazonProperties.bucketName}")
    private String bucketName;
    @Value("${amazonProperties.accessKey}")
    private String accessKey;
    @Value("${amazonProperties.secretKey}")
    private String secretKey;
@PostConstruct
    private void initializeAmazon() {
       AWSCredentials credentials = new BasicAWSCredentials(this.accessKey, this.secretKey);
       this.s3client = new AmazonS3Client(credentials);
}
}

Great question! Choosing between **Java** and **Python** for AWS Lambda depends on your use case, team expertise, and performance needs. Here's a detailed comparison to help you decide:

---

### üêç Python for AWS Lambda

#### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **Fast cold starts**: Python has minimal startup latency, making it ideal for short-lived or infrequent functions.
- **Lightweight code**: Fewer lines of code and smaller deployment packages.
- **Rapid development**: Easy syntax and rich ecosystem of libraries.
- **Popular for data tasks**: Great for scripting, automation, ML, and data processing.

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Slower runtime for heavy tasks**: Not ideal for CPU-intensive workloads.
- **Limited multithreading**: Python‚Äôs GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) can be a bottleneck.
- **Less structured**: May lead to messy codebases in large teams without strict discipline.

---

### ‚òï Java for AWS Lambda

#### ‚úÖ Advantages
- **High performance when warm**: JVM-based functions perform well once initialized.
- **Strong typing and structure**: Better for large-scale, enterprise-grade applications.
- **Robust tooling**: Mature ecosystem with powerful IDEs and frameworks.
- **Concurrency support**: Java handles multithreading efficiently.

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages
- **Slow cold starts**: JVM startup time is significantly higher, which can affect latency-sensitive apps.
- **Larger deployment packages**: JAR files and dependencies can be bulky.
- **Longer development cycles**: More verbose syntax and slower iteration speed.

---

### üß† When to Use Which?

| **Scenario**                          | **Recommended Language** |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Quick, lightweight functions         | Python                    |
| Data processing or ML tasks          | Python                    |
| Enterprise-grade backend logic       | Java                      |
| High concurrency or multithreading   | Java                      |
| Latency-sensitive APIs               | Python                    |
| Long-running, warm functions         | Java                      |
| Team expertise in one language       | That language             |

---

If you're still unsure, a good rule of thumb is:  
**Use Python for agility and simplicity. Use Java for structure and performance‚Äîespecially when cold starts aren't a concern.**
