Sure, here are some of the most important Spring Boot annotations:

@SpringBootApplication : This annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring Boot application. It is a combination of the following annotations:
@Configuration : This annotation indicates that the class contains Spring configuration.
@EnableAutoConfiguration : This annotation tells Spring Boot to automatically configure the application based on the dependencies 
							that are found on the classpath.
@ComponentScan : This annotation tells Spring Boot to scan the class for components, such as beans, services, and repositories.


@Component : This annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring component. 
This means that the class can be auto-detected and configured by Spring Boot.

@Autowired : This annotation is used to inject dependencies into a class. 
For example, you can use @Autowired to inject a database connection into a class.

@Value : This annotation is used to inject environment variables or system properties into a class. 
For example, you can use @Value to inject the value of the spring.datasource.url environment variable into a class.


@RestController : This annotation is used to mark a class as a REST controller. This means that the class can be used to expose RESTful APIs.




Spring Boot provides a wide range of annotations that simplify the development of Spring applications. These annotations are categorized into various groups, such as configuration, dependency injection, web, data, testing, etc. Below is a comprehensive list of commonly used Spring Boot annotations, categorized for better understanding:

---

### **Core Spring Boot Annotations**
1. **@SpringBootApplication**  
   Combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`. It is the primary annotation used to bootstrap a Spring Boot application.

2. **@EnableAutoConfiguration**  
   Enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.

3. **@ComponentScan**  
   Scans for components, configurations, and services in the specified package.

4. **@Configuration**  
   Indicates that a class is a configuration class that can define beans.

5. **@Bean**  
   Indicates a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.

6. **@ConditionalOnProperty**  
   Configures a bean to be loaded conditionally based on a property.

7. **@ConditionalOnMissingBean**  
   Configures a bean to be loaded only if a specific bean is not already defined.

8. **@ConditionalOnClass**  
   Configures a bean to be loaded only if a specific class is present on the classpath.

9. **@ConditionalOnMissingClass**  
   Configures a bean to be loaded only if a specific class is not present on the classpath.

10. **@Import**  
    Imports additional configuration classes.

### **Dependency Injection and Component Annotations**
1. **@Component**  
   Marks a class as a Spring-managed component.

   Specialization of `@Component` to indicate a DAO or repository.

4. **@Controller**  
   Specialization of `@Component` to indicate a web controller.

5. **@RestController**  
   Combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` to simplify web controller development.

6. **@Autowired**  
   Marks a field, constructor, or setter for dependency injection.

7. **@Qualifier**  
   Specifies which bean should be injected when multiple options are available.

8. **@Primary**  
   Marks a bean as the primary candidate when multiple beans of the same type exist.

9. **@Lazy**  
   Marks a bean to be lazily initialized.

10. **@Scope**  
    Defines the scope of a bean (e.g., singleton, prototype).

11. **@Value**  
    Injects values (e.g., from properties files) into fields, methods, or constructors.

7. **@ResponseBody**  
   Indicates that the return value of a method should be written directly to the HTTP response body.

8. **@RequestBody**  
   Maps the body of an HTTP request to a method parameter.

9. **@RequestParam**  
   Maps a request parameter to a method parameter.

10. **@PathVariable**  
    Maps a URI template variable to a method parameter.

11. **@ModelAttribute**  
    Binds a model attribute to a method or method parameter.

12. **@SessionAttributes**  
    Marks attributes to be stored in a web session.
