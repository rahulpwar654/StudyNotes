Here‚Äôs a clear breakdown of the key components in an **OAuth 2.0** flow and how they interact:

## üîê OAuth 2.0 Actors Explained

| Component           | Role                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Owner**  | The user who owns the data and grants access to it.                  |
| **Client (Client Server)** | The application requesting access to the user's data (e.g., a mobile app or web app). |
| **Authorization Server** | Validates the user and issues access tokens to the client.       |
| **Resource Server** | Hosts the protected resources (e.g., user profile, photos, etc.) and validates access tokens. |

---

## üîÑ How They Work Together (Authorization Code Flow)

1. **Client** redirects the **Resource Owner** (user) to the **Authorization Server**.
2. **Resource Owner** logs in and grants permission.
3. **Authorization Server** returns an **authorization code** to the **Client**.
4. **Client** exchanges the code for an **access token**.
5. **Client** uses the **access token** to access data from the **Resource Server**.

## üß™ Real-World Example

Imagine a third-party app like LinkedIn trying to access your Google contacts:

- **Resource Owner**: You
- **Client**: LinkedIn
- **Authorization Server**: Google OAuth
- **Resource Server**: Google Contacts API

Let‚Äôs walk through the **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow** using **Gmail** as a real-world example. Suppose a third-party app (like Slack or Zoom) wants to access your Gmail inbox to send or read emails on your behalf.

---

## üìß Gmail OAuth Flow Explained

### 1. **Client Redirects Resource Owner to Authorization Server**
- You open Slack and click ‚ÄúConnect Gmail.‚Äù
- Slack (the **Client**) redirects you to **Google‚Äôs Authorization Server** (`https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth`) with parameters like:
  - `client_id` (Slack‚Äôs ID)
  - `redirect_uri` (where Google should send the response)
  - `scope` (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`)
  - `response_type=code`

### 2. **Resource Owner Logs In and Grants Permission**
- You log into your Google account.
- Google shows a consent screen: ‚ÄúSlack wants to read your Gmail messages.‚Äù
- You click ‚ÄúAllow.‚Äù

### 3. **Authorization Server Returns Authorization Code**
- Google redirects you back to Slack‚Äôs `redirect_uri` with a temporary **authorization code** in the URL:
  ```
  https://slack.com/oauth/callback?code=abc123xyz
  ```

### 4. **Client Exchanges Code for Access Token**
- Slack sends a POST request to Google‚Äôs token endpoint (`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`) with:
  - `code=abc123xyz`
  - `client_id`, `client_secret`
  - `redirect_uri`
  - `grant_type=authorization_code`

- Google responds with an **access token** (and optionally a **refresh token**):
  ```json
  {
    "access_token": "ya29.a0AfH6SM...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "scope": "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly"
  }
  ```

### 5. **Client Uses Access Token to Access Resource Server**
- Slack uses the access token to call Gmail‚Äôs API:
  ```
  GET https://gmail.googleapis.com/gmail/v1/users/me/messages
  Authorization: Bearer ya29.a0AfH6SM...
  ```

- Gmail (the **Resource Server**) verifies the token and returns your email data.

## üîê Summary of Roles

| Role               | Example in Gmail Flow                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Owner** | You (the Gmail user)                     |
| **Client**         | Slack (third-party app)                  |
| **Authorization Server** | Google OAuth (`accounts.google.com`)     |
| **Resource Server**| Gmail API (`gmail.googleapis.com`)       |
