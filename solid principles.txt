Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Open-Close Principle (OCP)
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)



The SOLID principles are five design principles in object-oriented programming (OOP). They are:

Single responsibility principle (SRP):
 A class should have only one responsibility. This means that a class should only be responsible for one thing,
 and should not be responsible for anything else.
 The SRP can be applied by creating a separate class for each responsibility. 
 For example, a class that manages user accounts should not also be responsible for managing user permissions.

 
Open-closed principle (OCP): 
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
 This means that a class should be able to be extended with new functionality without having to be modified.
 The OCP can be applied by using interfaces to represent abstract concepts. For example,
 an interface could be used to represent a database connection. This would allow different implementations of the database connection to be used without having to modify the code that uses the interface.

 
 
Liskov substitution principle (LSP): 
Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes. 
This means that a reference to a base class should be able to be used to refer to an object of a derived class without any loss of functionality.
The LSP can be applied by ensuring that derived classes inherit only the methods and properties that are needed by their clients. 
For example, a derived class that represents a car should not inherit the methods and properties for flying.



Interface segregation principle (ISP):
 Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces that they do not use. 
 This means that an interface should not have methods that are not needed by all of its clients.
 The ISP can be applied by creating multiple interfaces that each represent a specific set of methods and properties.
 For example, an interface could be created for representing a database connection that supports read operations. Another interface could be created for representing a database connection that supports write operations.

 
Dependency inversion principle (DIP):
 Depend upon abstractions, not concretions. This means that a class should depend on interfaces, not on specific implementations.
The SOLID principles are important for creating well-designed and maintainable software. 
They can help to make software easier to understand, change, and extend.
The DIP can be applied by using abstract classes or interfaces to represent dependencies. 
For example, a class that needs to connect to a database could depend on an abstract class or interface that represents a database connection. This would allow the class to be independent of the specific database that is being used.


Here are some examples of how the SOLID principles can be applied:

The SOLID principles are a valuable set of guidelines for object-oriented programming. By following these principles, developers can create well-designed and maintainable software.



###
Absolutely! The **SOLID principles** are five key object-oriented design guidelines that help make Java code more maintainable, scalable, and robust. Here's a breakdown with simple Java examples to illustrate each one:

---

### ðŸ§± 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
> A class should have only one reason to change.

**Bad Example:**
```java
public class Employee {
    public String getDetails() { /* ... */ }
    public void calculateSalary() { /* ... */ }
    public void sendEmail() { /* ... */ } // Violates SRP
}
```

**Improved Design:**
```java
public class Employee {
    public String getDetails() { /* ... */ }
    public void calculateSalary() { /* ... */ }
}

public class EmailService {
    public void sendEmail(String message) { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

### ðŸšª 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
> Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Bad Example:**
```java
public class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(Object shape) {
        if (shape instanceof Circle) { /* ... */ }
        else if (shape instanceof Square) { /* ... */ }
    }
}
```

**Improved Design:**
```java
interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public double calculateArea() { return Math.PI * r * r; }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    public double calculateArea() { return side * side; }
}

class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
        return shape.calculateArea();
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ§¬ 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

**Bad Example:**
```java
class Bird {
    public void fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Penguin extends Bird {
    public void fly() { throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); } // Violates LSP
}
```

**Improved Design:**
```java
interface Bird { }

interface FlyingBird extends Bird {
    void fly();
}

class Sparrow implements FlyingBird {
    public void fly() { /* ... */ }
}

class Penguin implements Bird {
    // No fly method, so no violation
}
```

---

### ðŸ§© 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**Bad Example:**
```java
interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
    void fly(); // Not all vehicles fly
}
```

**Improved Design:**
```java
interface Drivable {
    void drive();
}

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Car implements Drivable {
    public void drive() { /* ... */ }
}

class Plane implements Drivable, Flyable {
    public void drive() { /* ... */ }
    public void fly() { /* ... */ }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”Œ 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Bad Example:**
```java
class Engine { }

class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine(); // Tight coupling
}
```

**Improved Design:**
```java
interface Engine {
    void start();
}

class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() { /* ... */ }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}
```
